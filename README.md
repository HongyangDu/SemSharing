## üîß Environment Setup

To create a new conda environment, execute the following command:

```bash
conda create --name sems python==3.7
```
## ‚ö°Activate Environment

Activate the created environment with:

```bash
conda activate sems
```

## üì¶ Install Required Packages

The following packages can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib==3.1.3
pip install torch
pip install opencv-python==4.1.2.30
pip install scipy
pip install yacs
pip install torchvision
pip install scikit-image
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Run the Program

Run `run.py` to start the program.


## üîç Check the results

In this demo, we consider that there are two users, whose view images are:

![User1](readme/1.jpg)

![User2](readme/2.jpg)

After run the code, several results can be viewed in PyCharm:

![Pycharm results](readme/img1.png)

For instance, the safe walk area calculated by the first user:

Semantic matching results of two view images:

Another way to show semantic matching results of two view images:

How the second user transforms the view image of the first user to match their own view image:

The safe walk area information that the second user obtains based on the semantic information shared by the first user:
